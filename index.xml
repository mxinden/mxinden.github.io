      <description>We decided to turn our interest to BGP which we will devote 3 sessions to. In today&amp;rsquo;s session - the first one - we introduced BGP, looked at the convergence problem, as well as the solution suggested in the paper below.
Gao, Lixin, and Jennifer Rexford. &amp;ldquo;Stable Internet routing without global coordination.&amp;rdquo; IEEE/ACM Transactions on networking 9.6 (2001): 681-692.

      <description>I have created a new GPG key replacing my old GPG key. I did not loose access to the old one, nor was it, as far as I am able to tell, ever compromised. As I did with the old key, I will use the new key both for signing my open source work as well as securing my e-mail communication.
You can find both the old and the new key on all major key servers.</description>

      <description>What better way to start a new year than with a paper discussing how to change time?
In the 30th session we discussed a paper which I think has much up its sleeves - Attacking the Network Time Protocol. First off the paper gives us a good introduction to the inner working of the network time protocol. Next up it examines the broader ecosystem as well as why we need accurate time in the first place.</description>

      <description>With the 28th session we jumped into the space of byzantine fault tolerant consensus protocols. We covered fault tolerant consensus with various Paxos variants in the past, but this session was the first one looking into how to solve the byzantine generals problem.
Instead of using PBFT [1] as a first paper we went with Hotstuff [2] instead. The reasoning behind this choice was (a) Hotstuff presenting a somewhat easy up-to-date consensus algorithm and (b) that it provides a framework enabling one to compare other algorithms (e.</description>

      <description>I find it helpful to know the orders of magnitude by which certain computer operations differ. Certainly it is not worth the effort to pay attention to every digit or learn these by heart, especially since they differ (slightly) across systems, but having a basic understanding of what a tiny fraction of time a CPU cycle occupies compared to sending a TCP packet is incredibly helpful whenever reasoning about systems performance.</description>

      <description>We have long been planning to cover the caching mechanisms in CPUs. As a shared knowledge base for the discussions in this session we chose the following two articles by Martin Thompson among other things known for his work on the LMAX Disruptor:
  CPU Cache Flushing Fallacy including a good overview over the different caches in modern Intel CPUs.
  Write Combining exemplifying the advanced mechanisms one can find in today&amp;rsquo;s CPUs and how one can make use of them.</description>

      <description>In the session today we covered Madhavapeddi Shreedhar and George Varghese paper &amp;ldquo;Efficient fair queuing using deficit round-robin&amp;rdquo; [1]. While the session was not so much about the relatively simple algorithmic details of deficit-round-robin (still worth checking out) we talked about:
  Its benefits over basic FIFO queuing and thus its impact for congestion controlled traffic (tcp) compared to not congestion controlled traffic (udp).
  Its wide deployment still seen today.</description>

      <description>After a bit of a break due to current pandemic we decided to carry on and continue our meetings as virtual calls. Ignoring the usual initial hiccups and the missing whiteboard the medium worked well for us.
Topic and reading of this session was the ACM Queue article BBR: Congestion-Based Congestion Control [1], as well as the Dropbox article Evaluating BBRv2 on the Dropbox Edge Network [2].
We started off with a quick recap of the previous session covering why we need congestion control, how one can view a multi-hop connection as a single hop connection with a single bottleneck and most importantly the fact that the Internet is the largest distributed system that most of the time &amp;ldquo;just works&amp;rdquo; due to congestion control.</description>

      <description>I recently stumbled upon the idea of an Elimination Back-off Stack promising to be a parallel, linearizable and lock-free stack. In case you are not familiar with it, I would suggest either reading my previous post or the corresponding paper [1] itself. Being quite intrigued by the ideas of the above stack I wrote my own implementation in Rust with a little help from crossbeam.
In this post I will compare my implementation to other stack implementations.</description>

      <description>Reading The Art of Multiprocessor Programming [1] I came across the Elimination Back-off Stack [2] datastructure introduced in 2004 by Danny Hendler, Nir Shavit, and Lena Yerushalmi. It promises to be a parallel lock-free stack.
How can a stack allow parallel operations without going through a single serialization point, e.g. a Mutex or an Atomic? Let&amp;rsquo;s dive into it.
A lock-free stack A lock-free stack, also often referred to as a Treiber stack [3] due to Kent Treiber, operates on top of a lock-free linked list.</description>

      <description>At the end of the previous session one of us suggested to dive into congestion control algorithms. This has found a greater echo, thus the 23rd session covered congestion control algorithms in general and TCP&amp;rsquo;s Reno as well as TCP&amp;rsquo;s Tahoe in particular.
This weeks reading was:
  Chapter 13 &amp;ldquo;TCP Reno and Congestion Management&amp;rdquo; from the comprehensive online book &amp;ldquo;An Introduction to Computer Networks&amp;rdquo; [1] from the Loyola University Chicago.</description>

      <description>In the 22nd session we took a look at io_uring - a new Kernel interface for asynchronous I/O. Tyler, who is currently implementing an io_uring library in Rust [4] for his database sled [7] guided us through the concepts as well as a bunch of source code.
Tyler started off introducing the status quo of I/O interfaces within the Linux Kernel like read, pread and preadv, jumped over to asynchronous I/O like aio and eventually helped us develop a sense of what the perfect asynchronous I/O interface of the future could look like.</description>

This could be anything from Chandy–Lamport&amp;rsquo;s algorithm for global distributed snapshots [1] to things like conflict free replicated datatypes [2]. The event is open for anyone interested. I only ask people to come prepared.
In the last meeting (19th) we covered distributed hash tables.</description>

      <description>Within my work at Red Hat and Kubernetes SIG instrumentation  I have been working on kube-state-metrics , a Prometheus  exporter exposing the state of a Kubernetes cluster to a Prometheus monitoring system. In particular I have focused on performance optimizing metric rendering for both latency as well as resource usage. Below I want to describe our approach of metric driven performance tuning, using Prometheus to monitor kube-state-metrics on top of Kubernetes, which in itself enables Prometheus to monitor Kubernetes.</description>

      <description>Kube-state-metrics exposes Prometheus metrics of the state of a given Kubernetes cluster. The project uses the standard Prometheus client Golang library, which is not optimized for the very specific use case of kube-state-metrics.
This talk covers different optimizations like metric caching and improved text marshaling dividing CPU usage by a factor of 6 and memory and response time by a factor of 3 through introducing an intelligent Prometheus metric cache in the code hot path and optimizing memory allocations during response generation.</description>

      <description>Monitoring plays a crucial role in a microservice architecture. Restricting the management and configuration of the monitoring stack to the operations team results in workflow bottlenecks. Instead one could provide a self-service monitoring platform, enabling each team to easily setup monitoring for their applications and customize it to their needs. This gives each team the ability to deeply introspect their application, benchmark new features and alert on failures on their own.</description>

      <description>What If Component xxx Dies? Introducing Self-Healing Kubernetes
Kubernetes promises healing your application on all kinds of failure scenarios, but why not self-heal Kubernetes itself?
This talk introduces self-hosted Kubernetes (K8s inside itself) to autonomously recover from failure scenarios with the help of e.g. itself, systemd and checkpointing. We will ask and answer questions like “What happens when xxx dies”. The theory will be followed by a demo on a live cluster showcasing what happens when we kill central Kubernetes components, like the API-Server.</description>

      <description>Kubernetes is a powerful system to build and operate a modern cloud-native infrastructure. Monitoring with Prometheus ensures that Kubernetes stays healthy. Prometheus is a stateful application, so operating it in a cloud native environment can be a challenging task. The Prometheus Operator makes running highly available Prometheus clusters, and even an entire end to end monitoring pipeline, easily manageable. Max will explain the functionality of the Prometheus Operator and describe a desirable end-to-end monitoring stack, including alerts and dashboards.</description>

      <description>Distributing and deploying software inside (Docker-) containers for security, isolation and ease of use is the new big thing. But once you got all your services nicely wrapped - who takes care of all these containers?
The open source project Kubernetes, originating from Google, helps you manage containerized applications, as the operating system of your datacenter, treating hundreds of machines as a single resource pool. This talk introduces the core concepts of Kubernetes, its benefits and its huge ecosystem and gives you an idea of how Google controls parts of their gigantic infrastructure.</description>

      <description>Alertmanager deduplicates, groups, and routes alerts from Prometheus to all kinds of paging services. With it comes a dated UI which does not live up to the expectations of the users, nor does it attract new contributors.
From this talk, you will learn how we addressed these issues when building the new UI from scratch. We made it friendlier to users by removing unnecessary domain language noise. In addition we added new power features such as filtering and grouping.</description>

      <description>I woke up reasonably early on Saturday to go to the Golden Gaten Bridge. The bus ride from Ingleside took me an hour. I started my hike in the Presidio park along the west coast. I found some lonely beaches. I felt nothing like being in a city. Afterwards I walked over the Golden Gate Bridge where two friends of mine, Simon and Marc, picked me up. We drove to Muir Beach, Stinson Beach, Tiboron and Sausalito.</description>

This makes up for sleeping in a room with six other guys, living in an apartment with 21 guys with two bathrooms.</description>

      <description>Signed up for audience seats at the sitcom Last Man Standing. We had to arrive at 3 for the show to start at 6. They hired a comedian just to cheer up the audience - a little strange. It is very interesting to see how small the entire set actually is. Most of the times the actors only need 2 tries for one scene - extremly professional.</description>
