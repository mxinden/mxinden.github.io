      <description>Last Tuesday we meet again to discuss different attacks and possible countermeasures for distributed hash tables. More in particular we looked at Kademlia and its security extension S/Kademlia [1], possible eclipse attacks on the Ethereum network [2], a novel approach of hiding its own connection buckets as well as using an existing social graph as a network topology in the Whanau paper[3], security extensions to the Chord DHT [4], as well as a larger study of different security techniques for DHTs [5].</description>

      <description>I have been organizing a distributed systems paper reading group in Berlin for the last year. We meet every other week discussing a paper in the distributed systems space. This could be anything from Chandy–Lamport&amp;rsquo;s algorithm for global distributed snapshots [1] to things like conflict free replicated datatypes [2]. The event is open for anyone interested. I only ask people to come prepared.
In the last meeting (19th) we covered distributed hash tables.</description>

      <description>Within my work at Red Hat and Kubernetes SIG instrumentation  I have been working on kube-state-metrics , a Prometheus  exporter exposing the state of a Kubernetes cluster to a Prometheus monitoring system. In particular I have focused on performance optimizing metric rendering for both latency as well as resource usage. Below I want to describe our approach of metric driven performance tuning, using Prometheus to monitor kube-state-metrics on top of Kubernetes, which in itself enables Prometheus to monitor Kubernetes.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Metric Rendering in kube-state-metrics</title>
      <link>https://mxinden.github.io/talks/optimizing-metric-rendering-in-kube-state-metrics/</link>

      <guid>https://mxinden.github.io/talks/optimizing-metric-rendering-in-kube-state-metrics/</guid>
      <description>Kube-state-metrics exposes Prometheus metrics of the state of a given Kubernetes cluster. The project uses the standard Prometheus client Golang library, which is not optimized for the very specific use case of kube-state-metrics.
This talk covers different optimizations like metric caching and improved text marshaling dividing CPU usage by a factor of 6 and memory and response time by a factor of 3 through introducing an intelligent Prometheus metric cache in the code hot path and optimizing memory allocations during response generation.</description>

      <title>Self-Service Monitoring</title>

      <description>Monitoring plays a crucial role in a microservice architecture. Restricting the management and configuration of the monitoring stack to the operations team results in workflow bottlenecks. Instead one could provide a self-service monitoring platform, enabling each team to easily setup monitoring for their applications and customize it to their needs. This gives each team the ability to deeply introspect their application, benchmark new features and alert on failures on their own.</description>

      <description>What If Component xxx Dies? Introducing Self-Healing Kubernetes
Kubernetes promises healing your application on all kinds of failure scenarios, but why not self-heal Kubernetes itself?
This talk introduces self-hosted Kubernetes (K8s inside itself) to autonomously recover from failure scenarios with the help of e.g. itself, systemd and checkpointing. We will ask and answer questions like “What happens when xxx dies”. The theory will be followed by a demo on a live cluster showcasing what happens when we kill central Kubernetes components, like the API-Server.</description>

      <title>End-to-end monitoring with the Prometheus Operator</title>
      <link>https://mxinden.github.io/talks/end-to-end-monitoring-with-the-prometheus-operator/</link>

      <guid>https://mxinden.github.io/talks/end-to-end-monitoring-with-the-prometheus-operator/</guid>
      <description>Kubernetes is a powerful system to build and operate a modern cloud-native infrastructure. Monitoring with Prometheus ensures that Kubernetes stays healthy. Prometheus is a stateful application, so operating it in a cloud native environment can be a challenging task. The Prometheus Operator makes running highly available Prometheus clusters, and even an entire end to end monitoring pipeline, easily manageable. Max will explain the functionality of the Prometheus Operator and describe a desirable end-to-end monitoring stack, including alerts and dashboards.</description>

      <description>Distributing and deploying software inside (Docker-) containers for security, isolation and ease of use is the new big thing. But once you got all your services nicely wrapped - who takes care of all these containers?
The open source project Kubernetes, originating from Google, helps you manage containerized applications, as the operating system of your datacenter, treating hundreds of machines as a single resource pool. This talk introduces the core concepts of Kubernetes, its benefits and its huge ecosystem and gives you an idea of how Google controls parts of their gigantic infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Improving user and developer experience of the Alertmanager UI</title>
      <link>https://mxinden.github.io/talks/improving-user-and-developer-experience-of-the-alertmanager-ui/</link>

      <guid>https://mxinden.github.io/talks/improving-user-and-developer-experience-of-the-alertmanager-ui/</guid>
      <description>Alertmanager deduplicates, groups, and routes alerts from Prometheus to all kinds of paging services. With it comes a dated UI which does not live up to the expectations of the users, nor does it attract new contributors.
From this talk, you will learn how we addressed these issues when building the new UI from scratch. We made it friendlier to users by removing unnecessary domain language noise. In addition we added new power features such as filtering and grouping.</description>

I found some lonely beaches. I felt nothing like being in a city. Afterwards I walked over the Golden Gate Bridge where two friends of mine, Simon and Marc, picked me up. We drove to Muir Beach, Stinson Beach, Tiboron and Sausalito.</description>

      <description>My first day at the first Hacker House in Palo Alto. House cleaning is every Tuesday. I arrived on Monday. The people here are amazing. Many startup founders - smart people all over the place. The location, 635 Webster St., Palo Alto, is awesome, right in the center. This makes up for sleeping in a room with six other guys, living in an apartment with 21 guys with two bathrooms.</description>

      <description>Signed up for audience seats at the sitcom Last Man Standing. We had to arrive at 3 for the show to start at 6. They hired a comedian just to cheer up the audience - a little strange. It is very interesting to see how small the entire set actually is. Most of the times the actors only need 2 tries for one scene - extremly professional.</description>
