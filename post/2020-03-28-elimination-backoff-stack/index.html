of the stack or is null in case of an empty stack.">

It promises to be a parallel lock-free stack.\nHow can a stack allow parallel operations without going through a single serialization point, e.g. a Mutex or an Atomic? Let’s dive into it.\nA lock-free stack A lock-free stack, also often referred to as a Treiber stack [3] due to Kent Treiber, operates on top of a lock-free linked list. The entry point of the stack is an atomic pointer which is either pointing to the node on the very top of the stack or is null in case of an empty stack.\npub struct Stack\u003cT\u003e { head: Atomic\u003cNode\u003cT\u003e\u003e, } Each node on the stack contains its data as well as an atomic next pointer which is either null in the case where it is the last node of the stack (bottom plate) or a pointer to the next node.\nstruct Node\u003cT\u003e { data: ManuallyDrop\u003cT\u003e, next: Atomic\u003cNode\u003cT\u003e\u003e, } Push and pop operation A push operation creates a new Node, reads the current head, sets the next pointer of its new node to head and then tries to compare_and_set head to point to its new node. It loops until the final compare_and_set succeeds. A pop operation reads the current head. If the stack is empty head will be null thus pop can return. If the stack is not empty head will point to the first node. It reads that node and tries to compare_and_set head to point to the second node instead of the first one, again looping until the compare_and_set succeeds. On success it returns the data field of the first node.\nEmpty stack: +----+ |head| --\u003e null +----+ Non-empty stack: +----+ +----+ +----+ +----+ |head| --\u003e |next| --\u003e |next| --\u003e |next| --\u003e null +----+ |data| |data| |data| +----+ +----+ +----+ Performance The lock-free stack implementation above linearizes concurrent access through a single atomic head pointer on which push and pop operations loop trying to compare_and_set it. This single sequential execution point introduces contention when multiple threads try to push or pop at the same time thus making the entire stack implementation scale poorly. One can use exponential back-off by having a thread wait for a bit on compare_and_set failure before retrying.\nCan we do better?\nA lock-free elimination back-off stack A lock-free elimination back-off stack wraps a lock-free Treiber stack, but instead of simply exponentially backing off on compare_and_set failures, it uses something called an elimination array to back-off in space instead of time.\nElimination Array The stack datastructure allows two operations: push and pop. A push followed by a pop leaves a given stack in the same state as it was before the two operations. Thus the two operations cancel out. An elimination array is a fixed size array where each slot enables a thread executing a push operation to hand its item over to a thread executing a pop operation canceling the two out. A reasonable size for the elimination array would be the amount of threads operating on the datastructure.\nInitial state +----+ +----+ +----+ +----+ |head| --\u003e |next| --\u003e |next| --\u003e |next| --\u003e null +----+ |abcd| |efgh| |ijkl| +----+ +----+ +----+ After push operation +----+ +----+ +----+ +----+ +----+ |head| --\u003e |next| --\u003e |next| --\u003e |next| --\u003e |next| --\u003e null +----+ |push| |abcd| |efgh| |ijkl| +----+ +----+ +----+ +----+ After pop operation == initial state +----+ +----+ +----+ +----+ |head| --\u003e |next| --\u003e |next| --\u003e |next| --\u003e null +----+ |abcd| |efgh| |ijkl| +----+ +----+ +----+ Both push and pop try to succeed on the lock-free stack first. On contention an operation’s compare_and_set is likely to fail. Instead of backing-off by waiting a bit and retrying on the stack, an operation would try to exchange with its counterpart on the elimination array instead.\npub struct EliminationArray\u003cT\u003e { exchangers: Vec\u003cExchanger\u003cT\u003e\u003e, } pub struct Exchanger\u003cT\u003e { item: Atomic\u003cItem\u003cT\u003e\u003e, } enum Item\u003cT\u003e { Empty, Waiting(ManuallyDrop\u003cT\u003e), Busy, } In order for a push operation to exchange its data with a pop operation, the push operation first selects an Exchanger within the elimination array at random. It then checks the item field of the Exchanger.\nIf it is Empty the Exchanger is currently not in use. Thus it can compare_and_set it to Waiting with the data it wants to exchange. Next it loops until a corresponding pop operation sets the Item to Busy signaling a successful exchange. As a final step the push operation cleans up after itself by setting the Exchanger back to Empty for future exchanges to happen.\nIf it is Waiting the Exchanger is currently in use by another push operation waiting for a pop operation. Our push operation should try another Exchanger within the elimination array instead.\nIf it is Busy the Exchanger is currently in use by another push operation that already exchanged its data with a pop operation but has not yet done the final step. Our push operation should again try another Exchanger.\nIn order for a pop operation to eliminate with a push operation and receive its data it picks, just like a push operation, an Exchanger within the elimination array at random. It then checks the item field of that Exchanger.\nIf it is Empty the Exchanger is currently not in use. Instead of waiting for a push operation the pop operation tries another Exchanger within the elimination array.\nIf it is Waiting a push operation is currently waiting for a pop operation. Thus the pop operation can try to compare_and_set the Item to Busy. On success it is done and returns the data on failure it tries another Exchanger within the elimination array.\nIf it is Busy a push operation successfully exchanged with another pop operation and is just missing to do its final step. In that case our pop operation should try another Exchanger within the elimination array.\nBacking-off in space instead of time Steps of push and pop operations can fail on the elimination array due to too much contention or no contention. An example for the former would be a pop operation failing to compare_and_set an Item from Waiting to Busy due to another pop operation getting there first. On such contention one could back-off by exponentially waiting a bit. Instead operations on the elimination array back-off in space and not time. Backing-off in space instead of time enables the elimination back-off stack to be used by multiple operations in parallel. They do so by increasing the amount of Exchangers they consider when randomly selecting one from the elimination array.\nBacking-off in space instead of time enables the elimination back-off stack to be used by multiple operations in parallel.\nFor example at first a pop operation that failed on the lock-free stack selects one out of the two first exchangers of the elimination array. If it fails on that Exchanger due to contention it selects one out of the four first exchangers of the elimination array.\nLiveness To ensure a push operation does not starve waiting for a pop operation, or a pop operation unsuccessfully looking for a push operation on different Exchangers, they should first of all decrease the amount of Exchangers they consider out of all the Exchangers when witnessing missing contention. Second of all operations should eventually try the lock-free stack again, given that with low contention they will likely succeed on it directly.\nConclusion Combining a lock-free stack with an elimination array results in a lock-free linearizable and parallel stack. Linearizable as push and pop operations appear to take effect instantaneously for all threads at some moment between their invocation and response. Parallel due to the fact that multiple push and pop operations can cancel each other out on the elimination array.\nReferences [1] Herlihy, Maurice, and Nir Shavit.

<code>head</code> will be <code>null</code> thus <code>pop</code> can return. If the stack is not empty <code>head</code>
will point to the first node. It reads that node and tries to <code>compare_and_set</code>

the <code>compare_and_set</code> succeeds. On success it returns the <code>data</code> field of the

<p>The lock-free stack implementation above linearizes concurrent access through a
single atomic <code>head</code> pointer on which <code>push</code> and <code>pop</code> operations loop trying to
<code>compare_and_set</code> it. This single sequential execution point introduces
contention when multiple threads try to <code>push</code> or <code>pop</code> at <em>the same time</em> thus
making the entire stack implementation scale poorly. One can use exponential
back-off by having a thread wait for a bit on <code>compare_and_set</code> failure before
retrying.</p>
<p><em>Can we do better?</em></p>

<p>A lock-free elimination back-off stack wraps a lock-free Treiber stack, but
instead of simply exponentially backing off on <code>compare_and_set</code> failures, it
uses something called an elimination array to back-off in space instead of time.</p>
<h3 id="elimination-array">Elimination Array<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#elimination-array">#</a></h3>
<p>The stack datastructure allows two operations: <code>push</code> and <code>pop</code>. A <code>push</code>
followed by a <code>pop</code> leaves a given stack in the same state as it was before the
two operations. Thus the two operations <em>cancel out</em>. An elimination array is a
fixed size array where each slot enables a thread executing a <code>push</code> operation
to hand its item over to a thread executing a <code>pop</code> operation <em>canceling</em> the
two out. A reasonable size for the elimination array would be the amount of
threads operating on the datastructure.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>If it is <strong><code>Empty</code></strong> the <code>Exchanger</code> is currently not in use. Thus it can
<code>compare_and_set</code> it to <code>Waiting</code> with the <code>data</code> it wants to exchange. Next
it loops until a corresponding <code>pop</code> operation sets the <code>Item</code> to <code>Busy</code>
signaling a successful exchange. As a final step the <code>push</code> operation cleans
up after itself by setting the <code>Exchanger</code> back to <code>Empty</code> for future
exchanges to happen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it is <strong><code>Waiting</code></strong> the <code>Exchanger</code> is currently in use by another <code>push</code>
operation waiting for a <code>pop</code> operation. Our <code>push</code> operation should try
another <code>Exchanger</code> within the elimination array instead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it is <strong><code>Busy</code></strong> the <code>Exchanger</code> is currently in use by another <code>push</code>
operation that already exchanged its <code>data</code> with a <code>pop</code> operation but has not
yet done the final step. Our <code>push</code> operation should again try another

<p>In order for a <code>pop</code> operation to eliminate with a <code>push</code> operation and receive
its <code>data</code> it picks, just like a <code>push</code> operation, an <code>Exchanger</code> within the

<p>If it is <strong><code>Empty</code></strong> the <code>Exchanger</code> is currently not in use. Instead of
waiting for a <code>push</code> operation the <code>pop</code> operation tries another <code>Exchanger</code>
within the elimination array.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it is <strong><code>Waiting</code></strong> a <code>push</code> operation is currently waiting for a <code>pop</code>
operation. Thus the <code>pop</code> operation can try to <code>compare_and_set</code> the <code>Item</code> to
<code>Busy</code>. On success it is done and returns the <code>data</code> on failure it tries
another <code>Exchanger</code> within the elimination array.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it is <strong><code>Busy</code></strong> a <code>push</code> operation successfully exchanged with another

<p>Steps of <code>push</code> and <code>pop</code> operations can fail on the elimination array due to
too much contention or no contention. An example for the former would be a <code>pop</code>
operation failing to <code>compare_and_set</code> an <code>Item</code> from <code>Waiting</code> to <code>Busy</code> due to
another <code>pop</code> operation getting there first. On such contention one could
back-off by exponentially waiting a bit. Instead operations on the elimination
array back-off in space and not time. Backing-off in space instead of time
enables the elimination back-off stack to be used by multiple operations in
parallel. They do so by increasing the amount of <code>Exchanger</code>s they consider when
randomly selecting one from the elimination array.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Backing-off in space instead of time enables the elimination back-off stack to
be used by multiple operations in <strong>parallel</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>For example at first a <code>pop</code> operation that failed on the lock-free stack
selects one out of the two first exchangers of the elimination array. If it
fails on that <code>Exchanger</code> due to contention it selects one out of the four first
exchangers of the elimination array.</p>
<h3 id="liveness">Liveness<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#liveness">#</a></h3>
<p>To ensure a <code>push</code> operation does not starve waiting for a <code>pop</code> operation, or a
<code>pop</code> operation unsuccessfully looking for a <code>push</code> operation on different
<code>Exchanger</code>s, they should first of all decrease the amount of <code>Exchanger</code>s they
consider out of all the <code>Exchanger</code>s when witnessing missing contention. Second
of all operations should eventually try the lock-free stack again, given that
with low contention they will likely succeed on it directly.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>Combining a lock-free stack with an elimination array results in a <em>lock-free</em>
<em>linearizable</em> and <em>parallel</em> stack. <em>Linearizable</em> as <code>push</code> and <code>pop</code>
operations appear to take effect instantaneously for all threads at some moment
between their invocation and response. <em>Parallel</em> due to the fact that multiple
<code>push</code> and <code>pop</code> operations can <em>cancel</em> each other out on the elimination
array.</p>
