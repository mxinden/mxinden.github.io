<p>For people wanting to dive deeper here is a list of resources mentioned during

<p>The IETF draft.</p>

<p>BBR uses ACKs to estimate round-trip-time and bandwidth. On Wifi ACKs can be
aggregated, thus distorting these measurements. The below link shows the
corresponding kernel patch tackling this issue.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Following up on the concerns above there is a PacketPushers podcast covering
the topic.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>While BBR might work well for the connection itself, it is quite aggressive
and thus can have an impact on loss-based congestion control algorithms like
Rino. The following paper provides more details in section 4.C.2.</p>

</ul>
<p>For the next session we will stay within the realm of networking and talk about
packet scheduling and queuing in Linux and how one can implement QoS (Quality of
