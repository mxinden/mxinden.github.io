monitoring team and the rkt container engine team

full-time as a software engineer and ultimately was invited to be part of the
upstream Prometheus team due to my contributions to
the Alertmanager sub-project.

Alertmanager,
e.g. writing parts of its Elm-based UI and introducing API
v2, a bit on Prometheus

kube-state-metrics.
In addition being part of the open source project enabled me to speak at many
