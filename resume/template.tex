% This ^^^ is a standard LaTeX document class declaration
% (the previous line is a pseudo-comment, declaring that we will
% use the special XeTeX machinery for its more extensive font list
% and its use of unicode.)
% If you made this line more akin to the one in the default 
% latex.template file, say:
% \documentclass$if(fontsize)$[$fontsize$]$endif${scrartcl}
% then you would have a 'variable', fontsize, and could write things
% like `markdown2pdf my.txt --xetex --variable=fontsize:12pt -o my.pdf` or
% `markdown2pdf my.txt --xetex --variable=fontsize:24pt`. I have a couple
% of basic templates I call with `--template=whatever.template` and 
% adjust things like font size as I please. 

% Here's an alternative command for two column landscape 
% uncomment this and comment the above and you will have ...
% 2 columns landscape, not bad for some purposes. (If you strike
% the word 'landscape' you will have two narrow newspaperlike
% columns; scientists like that, because irrationality must
% show itself somewhere):

%\documentclass[12pt,twocolumn,landscape]{scrartcl} 
%\setlength{\columnsep}{.5in}

% ^^^ columns are too close together in LaTeX so we add this 
% `columnsep` command.


% I use the special 'komascript' article class "scrartcl" 
% reasons I can't entirely remember; I'm not sure it's that great.
% One reason is the unimportant one that, like many classes,
% it allows very big fonts which are convenient for booklet printing 
% in the idiotic American way by shrinking letterpaper pages, 
% which is what I usually do.  
% 12pt, specified above is a rational font size of course.

% the standard LaTeX 'article' class declaration would be something like:
% \documentclass[12pt]{article} 
% or for big type:
% \documentclass[24pt]{extarticle}
% but these restrict you to old-fashioned LaTeX materials.
% note that Kieran Healy uses the swank 'memoir' class, which might be
% worth a look. 


% This template needs to be called with the `--xetex` flag. 
% -- We are in swanky unicode, XeTeX land, and must now import these packages:
\usepackage{fontspec,xltxtra,xunicode}



% pandoc imports the extensive `amsmath` collection of symbols 
% for typesetting ordinary math.  
\usepackage{amsmath}
% if you use exotic symbols you need to import specific packages, eg. for
% electrical engineering diagrams, musical notation, the unspeakable rites
% of freemasonry etc.


% The `babel` package, among other things, lets you determine what 
% language you are using in a given stretch of text, so that typesetting 
% will go well. Here we specify that mostly, we are speaking English:
\usepackage[english]{babel}


% the `geometry` package makes for convenient adjusting of margins, which is what
% you asked about.  Of course it can do much more, even make coffee for you. 

\usepackage{geometry}
\geometry{verbose,letterpaper,tmargin=3cm,bmargin=3cm,lmargin=3cm,rmargin=3cm}
% so if you just keep a copy of this template in the directory you are working in, you
% can adjust the margins by going into this file and messing with the margins.
% the syntax is very unforgiving, but permits 3cm and 2.5in and some other things.


% Here I set my main font, which is an Apple Corporation Exclusive, golly. 
% it's okay, but note the long discussion of 'contextuals' which is necessary to cools off 
% some of its show-offy properties. You can make your essay look like the 
% Declaration of Independence by specifying e.g. Ligatures={Rare} 
% If you have a copy you might try it; as it is
% I will comment it out and supply something more certain to be around.
% \setmainfont{Hoefler Text}
% \setromanfont[Mapping=tex-text,Contextuals={NoWordInitial,NoWordFinal,NoLineInitial,NoLineFinal},Ligatures={NoCommon}]{Hoefler Text}

% \setmainfont{Times Roman}
% properly one should specify a sanserif font and a monospace font
% see e.g. the example of Kieran Healy. But I hate sanserif fonts, 
% and anyway there are defaults.

% These commands keep the koma system from making stupid sans serif section headings
% \setkomafont{title}{\rmfamily\mdseries\upshape\normalsize}
% \setkomafont{sectioning}{\rmfamily\mdseries\upshape\normalsize}
% \setkomafont{descriptionlabel}{\rmfamily\mdseries\upshape\normalsize}

% everything that follows is copied from the pandoc default template:
% I will interpolate a few comments. 


% pandoc prefers unindented paragraphs in the European style:
\setlength{\parindent}{0pt}
%  ... with paragraph breaks marked by a slight lengthening of 
% the space between paragraphs:
\setlength{\parskip}{6pt plus 2pt minus 1pt}

\pagestyle{plain}  
% this just numbers the pages.  
% \pagestyle{empty} 
% would give you no numbering
% after one-million man-years of macro-composition, 
% there are also fancy pagestyles with much wilder options 
% for headers and footers, of course.

% if you have code in your footnotes, the million macro march 
% kind of bumps into itself.
% Pandoc, having just rendered your text into LaTeX, 
% knows whether the 'variable' `verbatim-in-note` is True, and 
% If it is, it asks for a  LaTeX package that solves the dilemma:
$if(verbatim-in-note)$
\usepackage{fancyvrb}
$endif$

% note sure what 'fancy enums' are; something to do with lists, 
% as the further comment suggests: 
$if(fancy-enums)$
% Redefine labelwidth for lists; otherwise, the enumerate package will cause
% markers to extend beyond the left margin.
\makeatletter\AtBeginDocument{%
  \renewcommand{\@listi}
    {\setlength{\labelwidth}{4em}}
}\makeatother
\usepackage{enumerate}
$endif$


% What if you make a table? -- pandoc knows, of course, and 
% then declares that its  variable `table` is True and 
% imports a table package suitable to its pleasantly simple tables. 
% Needless to say infinitely   complicated tables are possible in 
% LaTeX with suitable packages. We are spared the temptation:

$if(tables)$
\usepackage{array}

% Continuing on the topic of tables ... (we havent reached `endif`). 
% The commented out line below is in the default pandoc  latex.template.
% Some unpleasantness with table formatting must be corrected.

% This is needed because raggedright in table elements redefines \\:
\newcommand{\PreserveBackslash}[1]{\let\temp=\\#1\let\\=\temp}
\let\PBS=\PreserveBackslash

$endif$


% New topic: What if you use subscripts? 
% Pandoc remembers whether you did, assigning True to $subscript$ 
% It then needs to adopt a default with an incantation like this:
$if(subscript)$
\newcommand{\textsubscr}[1]{\ensuremath{_{\scriptsize\textrm{#1}}}}
$endif$



% markdown inclines us to use links, since our texts can be made into html. 
% Why not have clickable blue links even in 
% learned, scientific, religious, juridical, poetical and other suchlike texts? 
% Never mind that they have been proven to destroy the nervous system!

% First, what about the fact that links like http://example.com are 
% technically code and thus must not be broken across lines? 
% [breaklinks=true] to the rescue!

% Nowadays LaTeX can handle all of this with another half million macros:

\usepackage[breaklinks=true]{hyperref}
\hypersetup{colorlinks,%
citecolor=blue,%
filecolor=blue,%
linkcolor=blue,%
urlcolor=blue}
$if(url)$
\usepackage{url}
$endif$



% Images. In ye olde LaTeX one could only import a limited range of image
% types, e.g. the forgotten .eps files.  Or else one simply drew the image with suitable
% commands and drawing packages.  Today we want to import .jpg files we make with 
% our smart phones or whatever:

$if(graphics)$
\usepackage{graphicx}
% Comment from the pandoc default template:
% We will generate all images so they have a width \maxwidth. This means
% that they will get their normal width if they fit onto the page, but
% are scaled down if they would overflow the margins.
\makeatletter
\def\maxwidth{\ifdim\Gin@nat@width>\linewidth\linewidth
\else\Gin@nat@width\fi}
\makeatother
\let\Oldincludegraphics\includegraphics
\renewcommand{\includegraphics}[1]{\Oldincludegraphics[width=\maxwidth]{#1}}
$endif$



% Section numbering.  Here again is a variable you can specify on the commandline
% `markdown2pdf my.txt --number-sections --xetex --template=/wherever/this/is -o my.pdf`
$if(numbersections)$
$else$
\setcounter{secnumdepth}{0}
$endif$


% Wait, didn't we already discuss the crisis of code in footnotes?  
% Evidently the order of unfolding of macros required that
% we import a package to deal with them earlier
% and issue a command it defines now. (Or maybe that's not the reason;
% very often the order does matter as the insane system of macro expansion
% must take place by stages.)
$if(verbatim-in-note)$
\VerbatimFootnotes % allows verbatim text in footnotes
$endif$


% you can include stuff for the header from a file specified on the command line;
% I've never done this, but that stuff will go here:
$for(header-includes)$
$header-includes$
$endfor$


% If you specified title authors and date at the start of 
% your pandoc-markdown file, pandoc knows the 'values' of the
% variables: title authors date and fills them in.

$if(title)$
\title{$title$ \\ $subtitle$}
$endif$
\author{$for(author)$$author$$sep$\\$endfor$ \\ \\ \small Biemsmaar 4c,  53343 Wachtberg,  Germany \\ \small  IndenML@gmail.com \\ \small  +49 178 1493411}
\date{}
$if(date)$
 \date{$date$}
$endif$

% After filling in all these blanks above, or erasing them 
% where they are not needed pandoc has finished writing the 
% famous LaTeX *preamble* for your document.
% Now comes the all important command \begin{document}
% which will be paired with an \end{document} at the end.
% Pandoc knows whether you have a title, and has already
% specified what it is; if so, it demands that the title be rendered.  
% Pandoc knows whether you want a table of contents, you
% specify this on the command line.
% Then, after fiddling with alignments, there comes the real
% business: pandoc slaps its rendering of your text in the place of
% the variable `body`
% It then concludes the document it has been writing. 

\begin{document}


$if(title)$
\maketitle
$endif$

% $if(toc)$
% \tableofcontents
% 
% $endif$


$if(alignment)$
\begin{$alignment$}
$endif$

$body$

%$if(alignment)$
\end{$alignment$}
$endif$


\end{document}
