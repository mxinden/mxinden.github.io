			<p>In January 2017 I joined the company CoreOS as a test-engineer helping the
monitoring team and the <a href="https://github.com/rkt/rkt">rkt container engine team</a>
write reliable software. Eventually I joined the CoreOS' monitoring team
full-time as a software engineer and ultimately was invited to be part of the
upstream <a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus team</a> due to my contributions to
the <a href="https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager/">Alertmanager</a> sub-project.</p>
<p>Over the next 2 years and 4 month I <a href="https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3Amxinden">worked a lot on
Alertmanager</a>,
e.g. writing parts of its Elm-based UI and introducing <a href="https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager/pull/1352">API
v2</a>, a bit on <a href="https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3Amxinden">Prometheus
itself</a>
and a bunch within the overall Prometheus and Kubernetes ecosystem e.g. on
<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/issues/498">kube-state-metrics</a>.
In addition being part of the open source project enabled me to speak at many
<a href="https://max-inden.de/talks/">conferences and meetups</a>.</p>
<p>In May 2019 I left Red Hat, which had acquired CoreOS in 2018, thus I was not
working on Prometheus related topics on my day-to-day job anymore. My Prometheus
upstream contributions declined more and more over the next months. I eventually
stepped down as an <a href="https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager/pull/2153">Alertmanager
maintainer</a> in January and
now <a href="https://github.com/prometheus/docs/pull/1576">resigned from the Prometheus
team</a>.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://github.com/prometheus/docs/pull/1576">pull request</a> removing
myself from the team list:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In no way should this imply that I am not a very big fan of Prometheus! In
fact I just pushed for introducing native instrumentation into our main
product, bugged people not to use a global registry, added 1000 comments on
metric naming, pitched the power of metric-driven debugging and educated
everyone on the danger of a cardinality explosions.</p>
<p>I am very thankful for the last 2 years and 4 month! Thanks for including me.
Keep up this great work.</p>
