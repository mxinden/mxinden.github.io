      <description>In January 2017 I joined the company CoreOS as a test-engineer helping the monitoring team and the rkt container engine team write reliable software. Eventually I joined the CoreOS&amp;rsquo; monitoring team full-time as a software engineer and ultimately was invited to be part of the upstream Prometheus team due to my contributions to the Alertmanager sub-project.
Over the next 2 years and 4 month I worked a lot on Alertmanager, e.</description>

      <description>Within my work at Red Hat and Kubernetes SIG instrumentation I have been working on kube-state-metrics , a Prometheus exporter exposing the state of a Kubernetes cluster to a Prometheus monitoring system. In particular I have focused on performance optimizing metric rendering for both latency as well as resource usage. Below I want to describe our approach of metric driven performance tuning, using Prometheus to monitor kube-state-metrics on top of Kubernetes, which in itself enables Prometheus to monitor Kubernetes.</description>
