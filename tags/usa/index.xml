      <description>I woke up reasonably early on Saturday to go to the Golden Gaten Bridge. The bus ride from Ingleside took me an hour. I started my hike in the Presidio park along the west coast. I found some lonely beaches. I felt nothing like being in a city. Afterwards I walked over the Golden Gate Bridge where two friends of mine, Simon and Marc, picked me up. We drove to Muir Beach, Stinson Beach, Tiboron and Sausalito.</description>

Many startup founders - smart people all over the place. The location, 635 Webster St., Palo Alto, is awesome, right in the center. This makes up for sleeping in a room with six other guys, living in an apartment with 21 guys with two bathrooms.</description>

      <description>Signed up for audience seats at the sitcom Last Man Standing. We had to arrive at 3 for the show to start at 6. They hired a comedian just to cheer up the audience - a little strange. It is very interesting to see how small the entire set actually is. Most of the times the actors only need 2 tries for one scene - extremly professional.</description>
